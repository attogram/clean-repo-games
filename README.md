# How to contribute

* Find an open source game repository containing tracking codes, advertising, trojans, and/or excessive promotional content.
* Fork the respository
* Edit your fork, removing all tracking codes, advertising, trojans, and excessive promotional content
* Test! Make sure the game is still playable
* Fork this repository, add a link to your new cleaned version to the **[Games List](https://attogram.github.io/clean-repo-games/games.html)**, and submit a pull request

## Pull Requests to original repo

* Maintainers of the original repository are often open to removing analytics/advertising/etc.
  A simple and polite pull request with a cleaned version is then welcomed.
* Sometimes maintainers of the original repository require analytics/adverstising/etc
  on their own personal deployment (such as to *.gihub.io).  
  In these cases it is suggested the maintainers create a new "clean" branch for outside deployments.
