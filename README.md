# Clean Repo: Games

Welcome to the **Clean Repo: Games** project.

**Clean Repo: Games** is a collaborative project to **find and remove hidden tracking codes** and **excessive promotional content** from open source game repositories.

The type of things we remove:

* Analytics tracking codes (Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager)
* Advertising codes (Google Adsense)
* Trojans (Javascript Miners)
* Social Media promotional buttons
* promotional meta tags

## How to contribute

* Find an open source game repository containing tracking codes, trojans, and/or excessive promotional content.
* Fork the respository
* Edit your fork to remove all tracking codes and excessive promotional content
* Test! Make sure the game is still playable
* Fork this repository, add a link to your new cleaned version to the Games List below, and submit a pull request

### Nudging maintainers to get clean

* You may also create a pull request to the original game repository, containing your new clean version
